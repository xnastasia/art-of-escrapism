Most approaches to teaching machine learning focus on specific models and methodologies. While we are constantly discovering new techniques, one thing remains consistent: the quality of a model’s predictions is always going to depend on the quality of its dataset.

In this workshop, we will design and curate a dataset, and preview what an ML model that you can build yourself would look like.
