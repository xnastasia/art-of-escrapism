Most approaches to teaching machine learning focus on specific models and methodologies. While we are constantly discovering new techniques, one thing remains consistent: the quality of a model’s predictions is always going to depend on the quality of its dataset.

In this workshop, we will design and curate a dataset, and preview what an ML model that you can build yourself would look like. 



## Workshop Outline

#### 12:00 – 12:15

introductions

#### 12:15 – 12:30

overview: mini lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/xnastasia/art-of-escrapism)
- permanence of bias challenge
- what is bias
- what is scrapism
- what is escrapism why like escapism haha
- how to be honest in avoidant practices
- acceptance of inherent bias in data representation / data vizualization for machines

#### 12:30 – 12:45

bash tutorial
- make a folder
- navigation
- now we need stuff to put in the folder

#### 12:45 – 13:00

your dataset

#### 13:00 – 13:15

more bash
- process dataset
- 

#### 13:15 – 13:30

runway ML
- stylegans
- text processing
- utility of different models 
- asya put more specific models in here to discuss

#### 13:30 – 13:45

more bash
- make some nice representation of the dataset

#### 13:45 – 14:00

Hangout
