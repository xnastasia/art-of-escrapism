# The Art of E-Scrapism
### Data generation for Generation Data


**Instructor:** [Anastasia Davydova Lewis](http://xnast.asia) | [xnastasia](https://t.me/xnastasia) on Telegram
**Location:** [Situated Intelligence](https://phi.ca/en/antenna/situated-intelligence-approches-ethiques-de-lia/) | Online
**Time:** April 20, 2021 12PM PDT
**Tools:** bash, smartphone, computer with internet, [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/),[Scrapism](https://scrapism.lav.io/), or nothing.


Most approaches to teaching machine learning focus on specific models and methodologies. While we are constantly discovering new techniques, one thing remains consistent: the quality of a model’s predictions is always going to depend on the quality of its dataset.

In this workshop, we will design and curate a dataset, and preview what an ML model that you can build yourself would look like. 



## Workshop Outline

#### 12:00 – 12:15

introductions

#### 12:15 – 12:30

overview: mini lecture [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14OkRx99_WP_iOqLS9OmwuKDLwVtIq4q5XPSWms_assA/edit?usp=sharing)
- permanence of bias challenge
- what is bias
- what is scrapism
- what is escrapism why like escapism haha
- how to be honest in avoidant practices
- acceptance of inherent bias in data representation / data vizualization for machines

#### 12:30 – 12:45

bash tutorial [sam lavigne's command line intro](https://scrapism.lav.io/intro-to-the-command-line/)
- make a folder
- navigation
- now we need stuff to put in the folder

#### 12:45 – 13:00

###### Assignment: Dataset Creation

- What sort of data do you have? Notes, photos, videos, receipts, spreadsheets
- Find data vs Create data
- Label it


#### 13:00 – 13:15

manipulating data and labels
resizing 
renaming

#### 13:15 – 13:30

- [Runway models](https://app.runwayml.com/models)
- stylegans
- text processing
- utility of different models 

#### 13:30 – 13:45

more bash
- make some nice representation of the dataset

#### 13:45 – 14:00

hanging out
