Most approaches to teaching machine learning focus on specific models and methodologies. While we are constantly discovering new techniques, one thing remains consistent: the quality of a model’s predictions is always going to depend on the quality of its dataset.

In this workshop, we will design and curate a dataset, and preview what an ML model that you can build yourself would look like.

Scrapism is the artistic practice of web scraping, or of automatically collecting and transforming found digital material. It hinges upon a combination of curatorial practice, reverse engineering, and hoarding mentality. In this class students will learn how to scrape massive quantities of material from the internet with Python, and then use that material to make poetic, satirical, critical, political projects. Each session we will cover a different web scraping technique, with production assignments relating to text, image and video. We will explore surrealist, dadaist, situationist techniques such as detournement, collage, and cut-ups, and apply them to a contemporary digital context.

## Schedule

### 1. September 18th

Introductions. Using the terminal. Basic python. Reading lines.

#### Readings  
* [Intro to the command line](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/blob/master/reader-01-the-command-line.md)
* [Python basics](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/blob/master/reader-02-python-basics.md)
* [Artificial Hells (introduction and chapter 1)](https://selforganizedseminar.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bishop-claire-artificial-hells-participatory-art-and-politics-spectatorship.pdf) By Claire Bishop
* [A User’s Guide to Détournement](http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm)

#### Assignment
* Find three sentences (or phrases) in the wild. Your sentences could come from the internet or the real world, from a book, a store sign, a facebook post, a news article, product packaging, or from a restaurant menu. Anything is fine, but you must not write it yourself. Be prepared to recite what you have found next week in class.

### 2. September 25th

Python part 2. Manipulating text. Automating writing.

#### Readings  
* Tech reading 2 TBD  
* [The Cut Up Method](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/burroughs-cutup.html) by William Burroughs

#### Assignment
* Transform a non-poetic text into a poetic text using Python. It is up to you to determine how and why a text is poetic or non-poetic. If you are stuck, try techniques like sorting, randomizing, filtering, deleting, or replacing.
